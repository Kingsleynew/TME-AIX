    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we showcase a machine learning model to detect fraudulent cases for telecom service use. We will use a synthetic dataset with features relevant to telco user activities, such as call duration, data usage, and SMS count. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent events to help improve revenue assurance processes in the telco domain."
