# IoT Security Anomaly Detection

This project contains a machine learning model for anomaly detection for perimeter security using IoT Data.<br>
This idea came from the Telco Radio Field Teams, who are struggling to prevent theft and vandalism of C-RAN Deployments. As having camera based security feeds are not feasible (price/performance wise) using simple IoT devices with ALS, PIR vs Temperature & Humidity spikes at Base Station Closets can still be useful for detecting/predicting unwanted incidents.<br>
